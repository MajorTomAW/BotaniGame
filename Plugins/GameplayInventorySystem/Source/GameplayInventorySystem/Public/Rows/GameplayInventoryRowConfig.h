/**
 * UGameplayInventoryRowConfig
 *
 * Config class that defines a single row in the inventory.
 * Useful for defining both layouts in the inventory but also limitations on what can be placed in what row.
 * Besides cosmetic purposes, rows can also be used to define the max number of items that can be placed in a row,
 * or the max weight that a row can hold.
 * Maybe even a filter so that you can only add specific types of items to a row.
 * 
 * The most common example would be that you have two rows.
 * 1. Could be the QuickBar or HotBar that you can (always) see on your game HUD.
 * 2. Could be the rest of the Inventory that you can open and close.
 *
 * (Going further, you could have rows for different types of items, but that is a bit more advanced.
 * For example, in minecraft you have a row for the HotBar, a row for the main inventory, and a row for the armor slots.)
 *
 * However, if you don't change anything, the inventory will be a single row by default.
 * You can add more rows by adding more of these config objects and granting them to the inventory manager.
